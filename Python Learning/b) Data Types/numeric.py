# Numeric Types: int, float, complex

# INTEGER
# integers for numbers used in counting
# + or - numbers...no decimals
x = 10

# FLOAT
# floats are numbers used in measuring
# real number(X.Y)
y = 10.234

#  COMPLEX
# real part + imaginary part
# rectangular or cartesian co-ordinates
z = 25j

# use TYPE function to which which data type a variable or class belongs to
print(type(y))

# use ISINSTANCE function to check which class an object belongs to
print(isinstance(x, type))
